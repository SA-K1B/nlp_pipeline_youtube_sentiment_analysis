# NLP pipeline for Youtube comments sentiment analysis
 This project analyzes YouTube comment sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) to provide insights into audience feedback. The solution involves an NLP pipeline, starting with Requirement Analysis, followed by feasibility, data processing, sentiment classification, and visualization.
## Requirement Analysis:
 **Objective:** The goal is to classify YouTube comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments to analyze audience feedback.
 
 **Scope:** The analysis focuses on English-language comments from a specific video.
 
 **Expected Outcomes:** 
 
 - Each comment will be assigned a sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral).
 - The overall sentiment of the videoâ€™s audience will be summarized (percentage of positive comments).
        
## Feasibility Study:
**Data source**: Use the YouTube Data API to fetch comments from videos.

**Tools:** 
- Use NLP libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, or spaCy for sentiment analysis.
- Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for presenting results.
- For deployment, use frameworks like FastAPI or Flask.

**Resources:** 
- For larger datasets and fine-tuning models GPU is required.
- Use cloud platforms like Google Colab for resource-heavy tasks.
